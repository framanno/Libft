# Libft
Repository containing the files for the libft project at 42 School

					MY PERSPECTIVE
Completing this first project at 42 was definitely not easy for me. That’s why I highly recommend fully embracing the 42 philosophy: peer-to-peer is essential. Don’t let shyness hold you back, and don’t only talk to  people you met during the piscine. If you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to ask for help. On the other hand, if you’re ahead, don’t hesitate to assist those who are having a harder time. Hopefully, your good deeds will be rewarded.

Other important resources I’ve used for this project and throughout my journey at 42 have been:

Good luck!
